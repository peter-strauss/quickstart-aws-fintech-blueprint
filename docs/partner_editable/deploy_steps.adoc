=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.
. Check the AWS Region that's displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For other choices, see link:#_supported_regions[Supported Regions] earlier in this guide.

=== Install the AWS CDK and bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack

Before you launch the Quick Start, you need to install the AWS CDK and bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack. One way to do this is to run the following commands in https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell[AWS CloudShell^]. It may take a minute or so for your first CloudShell session to start. Alternatively, you can use your own integrated development environment (IDE), such as AWS Cloud9 or Visual Studio Code. 

. If you are not using CloudShell, verify that you have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[prerequisites^] for installing the AWS CDK.

. Install the AWS CDK as follows:

  npm install -g aws-cdk typescript
+
For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install[Install the AWS CDK^] in the AWS documentation.

. Verify the installation, and check the current version.

  cdk --version

. Bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack as follows: 

  export CDK_NEW_BOOTSTRAP=1
  cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION  
+
For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^].

If you're using CloudShell, you can open it again by choosing its icon on the AWS Management Console, as shown in <<cloudshell>>.

=== Launch the Quick Start

The first time you launch, deployment should take about {deployment_time} to complete. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

. Clone the resources defined in the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone {git_repo_url}
cd {quickstart-project-name}
npm install
----

. Launch the Quick Start by running the following:
+
```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```
+
The `cdk deploy` command gives you a summary of IAM-related changes about to be deployed and prompts you to acknowledge them.
